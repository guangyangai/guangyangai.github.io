[Regular expression](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) is something you will confront at your work eventually at some point.

Today at work, there is one colleague showed me this

```split_regex = re.compile(''',(?=(?:[^"]|'[^']*'|"[^"]*")*$)'’')```

** python re ** provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. 


Regular expressions are made of special characters such as  `|` and `(` and ordinary characters such as literal letters and numbers. Special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted.

#One "special" special character#
  * `\` either escape special characters (allow you to match special characters), or signal a special sequence (but `\` us also used as an escape sequence). **re** use backslash `\` to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. Therefore, to match a literal backslash, one would need to write ‘\\\\’ (First two `\\` is regular expression, and each backslash must be expressed as `\\` inside a regular Python string literal).
use python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns: `r”\n”` is a two-character string containing `\` and `n`
`“\n”` is one-character string containing a newline. patterns are usually expressed in python code using raw string notation.

#repetition qualifiers#

repetition qualifiers consist of greedy qualifiers such as `*`, `+`, `?` (match as much as possible) and non-greedy ones such as `|`

repetition qualifiers cannot be directly nested. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. (?:a{6}) any multiple of six ‘a’ characters
  * `.` any character except newline
  * `^` beginning
  * `$` end or just before the newline at the end
  * `*` 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
  * `+` 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
  * `?` 0 or 1
  * adding `?` after above qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy fashion (explain non-greedy)
  * `{m}` exactly m copies of the previous RE
  * `{m,n}` match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE
  * `{m,n}?` match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, but attempt to match as few as possible
  * `[]` a set of characters 
    * usage: 
      * `[amk]`: anyone of a,m,k
      * `[a-z]`,`[0-10]`,`[0-9A-Fa-f]` 
      * `[a\-z]`, `[a-]`
      * `[(+*)]`: special characters lose special meaning inside sets
      * `[^]`: matching complementing the set
      * `[\]]` or `[]]`: matching literal ‘]’
  * `|` or
  * `(…)` match whatever inside the parenthese, and indicates the start and end of a group
  * `(?….)` extension notation (this is somewhat advanced concept)
    * `(?iLmsux)` include the flags as part of the regular expression (instead of passing a flag argument to the re.compile() function)
    * `(?:)` non-capturing version, substring matched cannot be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later
    * `(?P<name>…)` substring matched by the group is accessible via symbolic group name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers and each group name must be defined only once.
	Named groups can be referenced in three contexts, but most commonly in two contexts
	  * `(?P=quote)` e.g. `(?P<quote>[‘“]).*?(?P=quote)` matching a string quoted with either single or double quotes, `.*?` is nongreedyly matching 0 or more repetitions of any character
	  * `m.group(‘quote’)`: `m` is the match object
    * `(?#)` comment; contents of the parentheses are ignored
    * `(?=...)` lookahead assertion matches (if … matches next but does not consume any string). 
    * `(?!…)` negative lookahead assertion (matches if … does not match next)
    * `(?<=...)` positive look behind assertion. Find matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match                      for a fixed length patten (...) that ends at the current position
    * `(?<!...)` negative lookbehind assertion. 
    * `(?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)`: 
	  



Let's look at some special cases：

"62,Mr. Holland's Opus (1995),Drama”

"'87332,"City Below, The (Unter dir die Stadt) (2010)",Drama'"
