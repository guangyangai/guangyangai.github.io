Data Scientist with a PhD degree in Engineering, with interest in finance and AI

### More Information

I am a Ph.D. graduate from Stanford University with a degree in Energy Resources Engineering. During my PhD, my research is about uncertainties quantification and prediction with uncertainty. I applied machine learning technologies in some of the projects in my [thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12123097), to predict contaminant transport and reservoir production. I got very interested in Machine learning and AI after I took a few core CS classes while at Stanford. I managed to get an opportunity to work in the data science field after graduation. 
I am a total life-learning believer. I passed CFA level I & II while at school. Right now, besides work, I am enrolled in the famous [Udacity's self-driving cars nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013). In addition, I actively participate in our company's internal deep learning reading slack group and have implemented and presented a few famous paper, such as a neural algorithm of artistic style.
