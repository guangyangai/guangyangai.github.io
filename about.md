Data Scientist with a PhD degree in Engineering, Enrolling in Udacity Self Driving Engineering Nanodegree

### More Information

I am a Ph.D. graduate from Stanford University with a degree in Energy Resources Engineering. Because of the terrible job market in oil industry by the time I graduate, I managed to get into data science field (also passed CFA level I & II meanwhile). Right now I am working as a data scientist in a start-up compnay at Boston. At the same time, I am taking the famous Udacity's self-driving cars nanodegree. I took a few courses related to that field while I was at Stanford, such as digital image processing and machine learning. As a matter of fact, I applied machine learning technologies in some of the projects in my theis, to predict contaminant transport and reservoir production. I got fascinated with the future possibilities of AI and computer vision. In the future, I want to further get involved with its development.
