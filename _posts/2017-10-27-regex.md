[Regular expression](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) is something you will confront at your work eventually at some point.

Today at work, there is one colleague showed me this 
```split_regex = re.compile(''',(?=(?:[^"]|'[^']*'|"[^"]*")*$)'’')```

python re: this module provides regular expression matching operations similar to those found in Perl. 
Unicode string
8-bit strings

re use backslash `\` to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning

to match a literal backslash: would need to write ‘\\\\’, regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal

use python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns: r”\n” is a two-character string containing \ and n
“\n” is one-character string containing a newline. patterns are usually expressed in python code using raw string notation


special characters: ‘|’, ‘(‘ 
special characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect how the regular expressions around them are interpreted

repetition qualifiers: *, +, ?, {m,n} etc.
‘*’, ‘+’, ‘?’ are greedy(match as much as possible)
repetition qualifiers cannot be directly nested. To apply a second repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. (?:a{6}) any multiple of six ‘a’ characters
  * ‘.’ any character except newline
  * ‘^’ beginning
  * ‘$’ end or just before the newline at the end
  * ‘*’ 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
  * ‘+’ 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE
  * ? 0 or 1
  * adding ? after above qualifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy fashion (explain non-greedy)
  * {m} exactly m copies of the previous RE
  * {m,n} match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE
  * {m,n}? match from m to n repetitions of the preceding RE, but attempt to match as few as possible
  * ‘\’ either escape special characters (allow you to match special characters), or signal a special sequence (but `\` us also used as an escape sequence)
  * [] a set of characters 
	  * usage: [amk], 
		     * [a-z],[0-10],[0-9A-Fa-f] 
		     * [a\-z], [a-]
		     * [(+*)]: special characters lose special meaning inside sets
		     * [^]: matching complementing the set
		     * [\]] or []]: matching literal ‘]’
  * ‘|’ or, nongreedy
  * (…) match whatever inside the parenthese, and indicates the start and end of a group
  * (?….) extension notation (this is somewhat advanced concept)
	  * (?iLmsux) include the flags as part of the regular expression (instead of passing a flag argument to the re.compile() function)
	  * (?:) non-capturing version, substring matched cannot be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later
	  * (?P<name>…) substring matched by the group is accessible via symbolic group name. Group names must be valid Python identifiers and each group name must be defined only once 
	  * named groups can be referenced in three contexts, but most commonly in two contexts
		      * (?P=quote) e.g. (?P<quote>[‘“]).*?(?P=quote) matching a string quoted with either single or double quotes, .*? is nongreedyly matching 0 or more repetitions of any character
		      * m.group(‘quote’): m is the match object
	  * (?#) comment; contents of the parentheses are ignored
	  * (?=...) matches if … matches next but does not consume any string (lookahead assertion). 
	  * (?!…) matches if … does not match next (negative lookahead assertion)
	  * (?<=...)



Let's look at some special cases：
"62,Mr. Holland's Opus (1995),Drama”
"'87332,"City Below, The (Unter dir die Stadt) (2010)",Drama'"
